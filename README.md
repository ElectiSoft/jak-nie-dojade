# Jak Nie Dojade

Much simpler version of jakdojade.pl, that uses open Gda≈Ñsk data to display departures of trams and buses.

## How to use?

Jak Nie Dojade isn't hosted anywhere, so if you want to use it you have to clone the repo:

```sh
https://github.com/ElectiSoft/jak-nie-dojade.git
```
then type yarn in order to download all packages:
```sh
yarn
```
and yarn start:
```sh
yarn start
```
Developer server will start and you will be able to view the app on localhost:3000. Now you just enter a stop name and pick destination. ENJOY :)
